> Far From Perfect - Because perfection is overrated.

Welcome to the home of the FFP project! Our organization is dedicated to embracing the beauty of imperfection in software development.

## About FFP

FFP (Far From Perfect) is built on the philosophy that continuous improvement is more valuable than seeking unattainable perfection. We believe in learning from mistakes and growing through iteration.

## Repositories

Our first couple of projects will be made public on December 1st, 2024. Stay tuned as we reveal multiple repositories showcasing the FFP philosophy in action!

## Get Involved

We welcome contributors who understand that the best solutions often emerge from embracing imperfection and learning through experience.
